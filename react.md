React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to creat interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right componebts when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their owen state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since compontent logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data througn your app and keep state out of the DOM.  
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new deatures in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power monile apps using [React Nactive](https://reactnative.dev/).

## Installation
***
React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, **and you can use as little or as much React as you need:**  
* Use [Online Playgrounds](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) as a `<script>` tag in one minute.
* [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.  

You can use React as a `<script>` tag from a [CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html)
, or as a `react` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react).
## Documentation  
***
You can find the React documentaition [on the website](https://reactjs.org/docs).  
Check out the [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) page for a quick overview.  
The documentation is divided into serveral sections:  
* [Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
* [Advanced Guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)
* [API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)
* [Where to Get Support](https://reactjs.org/community/support.html)
* [Contributing Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)  

You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org).  
## Examples   
We have several examples [on the website](https://reactjs.org/).Here is the first one to get you started:  
```js
function HelloMessage({ name }) {
    return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
    <HelloMessage name="Taylor" />,
    document.getEllementById('container')
);
```
This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.  
You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntaxl [we call it JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a `<script>` tag, read [this section](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#optional-try-react-with-jsx) on integrating JSx; otherwise, the [recommended JavaScript toolchains](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) handle it automatically.
